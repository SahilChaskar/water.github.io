An enviromental web for promoting water quality and wildfires

## This web app focuses on everyday environmental issues around the globe and spreading awareness about it. It shows all the needed data in all the right places for users to integrate as much as possible

## Inspiration

Recently a lot of wildfires have been happening around Europe and North America, yet all the web apps and other programs are made for administrators and professionals in that field. Therefore we got an idea - To spread awareness about environmental issues and make a user friendly app so anybody can see the information transparently.
We got this idea on the night of hackathon, as we were watching the news and heard that parts of Greece were still burning and that air was getting worse and worse. A couple of weeks ago, Belgium was flooded... So we decided to take action.

## What it does

This web app focuses on everyday environmental issues around the globe and spreading awareness about it. It shows all the needed data in all the right places for users to integrate as much as possible
